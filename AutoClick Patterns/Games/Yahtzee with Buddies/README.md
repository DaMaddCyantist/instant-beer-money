_DISCLAIMER: This AutoClick pattern was programmed on a **Google Pixel 5**.
Therefore, the location of the images may not be in the same location. 
Ensure that you go through the scenarios below by hand at least once before activating the AutoClicker._

## Scenario Walkthrough

Scenarios are based on what is currently seen on your device's screen. Therefore, you can make decisions based on certain things that are present (or not) on your screen.

Scenarios are executed from top to bottom. In this way, they act as logic gates based on what is currently seen on the screen.

Our goal in Yahtzee with Buddies is to reach level 34. This takes a considerable amount of time since you need approximately 75K XP to reach level 32, AND playing matches against random players takes a variable amount of time to complete a game. 

Furthermore, you receive 100XP for losing the game, 150XP for winning the game, a red scratch-off for completing the match with a buddy, and a black scratch-off for every five games you complete with a buddy.

**Our advantage is that we can play against ourselves on another device to finish matches as quickly as possible.**

For this reason, we have two variations of the click pattern:
1. Master
2. User

Although both click patterns accomplish the goal of playing Yahtzee, one device must be able to initate rematches with the other device.

Therefore, the 'Master' click pattern will be used to initiate rematches between our devices and the 'User' click pattern will accept the rematch challenge from 'Master'.

### Here are our scenarios:

---

#### 1. Roll Dice
    Click the 'Roll' button if the button is present.

#### 2. Play
    Click the 'Play' button if the button is present (After rolling the dice and selecting a square).

#### 3. Select Square
    Randomly select a playable square to place your score after rolling the dice.

#### 4. Click Rematch [Master]
    Click the 'Rematch' button if the button is present.

#### 5. Click user name [User]
    Once at the main menu, click the name of the 'Master' user to bring up the 'Accept Challenge' screen.

#### 6. Continue
    If the game has ended, click the screen to continue to the next screen(s).

#### 7. Accept Challenge [User]
    Accept the challenge from 'Master'
    
#### 6. Close
    If a pop-up appears, close the pop-up.

We did our best to capture various ad exit symbols but add more as you monitor the AutoClicker.
