## Scenario Walkthrough

Scenarios are based on what is currently seen on your device's screen. Therefore, you can make decisions based on certain things that are present (or not) on your screen.

Scenarios are executed from top to bottom. In this way, they act as logic gates based on what is currently seen on the screen.

Our goal in Yahtzee with Buddies is to reach level 34. This takes a considerable amount of time since you need approximately 75K XP to reach level 32, AND playing matches against random players takes a variable amount of time to complete a game. 

Furthermore, you receive 100XP for losing the game, 150XP for winning the game, a red scratch-off for completing the match with a buddy, and a black scratch-off for every five games you complete with a buddy.

**Our advantage is that we can play against ourselves on another device to finish matches as quickly as possible.**

### Here are our scenarios:

---

#### 1. Ad for Depth
    If an 'AD' button appears on the depth upgrade, click on the button to watch an ad.

#### 2. Continue game
    If there is no Ad for Depth, continue playing the game.

#### 3. No Revive
    If you 'fail' and the 'Revive' prompt appears, click outside the prompt to continue the game.

#### 4. Claim or No Thanks
    If there is a prompt to click 'Claim' or 'No Thanks', click the prompt.

        1. Resume the video.
        2. Wait 15 seconds before trying to close the ad again.
    
#### 6. Close Ads - X
    If we are watching an ad, attempt to close the ad by clicking the 'X' once the timer has expired.

#### 7. Close Ads - Arrow
    If we are watching an ad, attempt to close the ad by clicking the arrow icon once the timer has expired.    

#### 8. Exit Store
    If we attempt to close ad and it opens the app store instead:
        1. Press back button to return to app store main screen.
        2. Swipe left-to-right on screen to return to the ad before trying to close the ad again.

#### 9. Exit Web
    If we attempt to close ad and it opens the web browser instead:
        1. Swipe left-to-right on screen to return to the ad 
        2. Wait a few seconds before trying to close the ad again.
        

Please add additional screenshots and scenarios as needed. For example, the 'Close Ads' scenario will need to be updated as new ads are introduced to the game.

We did our best to capture various ad exit symbols but add more as you monitor the AutoClicker.

**Please monitor your AutoClicker.** There may be unexpected results if left unattended for long periods.
